## Project Structure
Data Loading and Preprocessing: The notebook begins with loading the necessary data for the classification task, followed by preprocessing steps to prepare the data for model training.
Model Training: This section details the setup for training the BERT model, including configuration of learning rates, batch size, and other hyperparameters.
### Evaluation: 
After training, the model's performance is evaluated on a validation set to assess its accuracy and other metrics.
### Results Output: 
The final predictions of the model are saved to a CSV file, which could be used for further analysis or submission to a competition.

## Requirements
